class_name Skateboard
extends Node3D
## Tim Cope's Pro Skater: a skateboard the Player picks up with "action" and rides through the Player's
## [Riding] state. The board owns the movement, the sounds and its own [SkateboardCamera]; the Player only
## lends its body, its input and its animations (requested through the rideable signals), and its Riding state
## makes [member camera] current and turns the Player's step-up ray off while the board owns the ground.
##
## The physics follows Neversoft's THUG skater (SkaterCorePhysicsComponent: maybe_straight_up, the vert tracking
## of do_in_air_physics, maybe_break_vert, do_jump, handle_ground_rotation). On the ground the board follows
## the floor normal, so speed carries up a transition and gravity along the surface slows the climb; transitions
## count as floor almost to vertical. Leaving a wall steeper than [constant VERT_ANGLE] is a vert launch: the
## velocity is rotated into the wall's vertical plane with its speed kept, and through the air the skater is held
## in that plane while the wall is still behind them, so they go up and come back down onto the same wall.
## Holding forward at the lip breaks vert instead and flies over the deck. Left and right spin the skater in the
## air, and every landing turns them to face the way they are rolling.

signal locomotion_requested(state_path: String, immediate: bool) ## Asks the rider to play an animation node.
signal locomotion_blend_requested(path: String, value: float) ## Asks the rider to set an animation blend value.
signal jump_requested ## Asks the rider to run its jump animation (the pop itself is applied here).
